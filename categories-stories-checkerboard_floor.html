					I’m sitting down, staring at the black checkerboard floor. I look up and watch my mother’s tears form a puddle as my dad tries to wipe her tears like a mop. I see my mother’s guilt as she signs, with pen in hand, the documents that would break up our family forever. That’s the moment when my sister was transferred to a small school in Indiana for the mentally impaired and disabled.
				</p>
				<p>
					My sister suffers from severe autism. I was never really close to her. We lived in the same house pretty much my whole childhood, however, we rarely were in the same room with each other. I always felt somehow that my sister attracted all the attention away from me. Every instance when she whined, my parents fled to her rescue. Every time I turned the corner, I overheard her name circulating in the room. Because of her rigid and peculiar behavior, I grew afraid of interacting with anyone outside my family when I was around her. I would get embarrassed with all the eyes that would stalk me as a result of them observing my sister. It was already difficult for me to make friends because of my shyness and introversion, but having my sister by my side made it more troublesome to connect with society. Over time, I grew bitter and avoided her. I treated her as if she were a nuisance.
				</p>
				<p>
					As she got older and older, she became more and more aggressive. She had the habit of attacking my parents, pushing them like colliding dominos, squishing their hands like a vise. In many instances, they suffered bruises, both physically and emotionally. This “phase” of hers spans over two years. Our family became very distant, and the situation became hopeless. The continuous struggle between my sister and my parents instigated thoughts of sending her away…away from home.
				</p>
				<p>
					As my mother lifts her pen from the damp mark she made, she lets go of my sister’s hand as they began to pull her away. Before my sister left the room, she looked at me…and gave me a smile. It was as if she were saying to me, “I love you,” for the last time. That was the moment when I realized that she truly loved me. Throughout all my neglect and envy, she was always by my side. Even when she was in an aggressive state, she never laid a finger on me. Looking back on it, I truly realize that sending her away was the biggest misstep we have made.
				</p>
				<p>
					Months flew by, and the house became too quiet. Our home felt so empty, and the dinners were lonely without her. I remember that my sister used to sing along to the hum of the rice cooker. After she was gone, my parents and I would do the same in unison. It was within those months that I understood that she didn’t tear the family apart, but she often held it together. We didn’t send her away from home, but we sent home away from us.
				</p>
				<p>
					After two years, our family decided that her presence needed to be reintroduced into our lives. We understood that bringing her home in which she would reside with us would only rekindle the tensions and conflict we previously had. Therefore, we determined that it would be best for her to have a living situation where she would have the 24/7 care that she needs and the comfort that she deserves. Now, she is a fifteen-minute driving distance away from us rather than a four hour one, and she lives in a small house where she can fully express herself.
				</p>
				<p>
					My sister is fundamental to my identity and my well-being. She taught me how to love, to be grateful, to be compassionate, to be accepting, and to be the humble person I am today. She influenced my continuous pursuit of knowledge, my hard work, and my desire to prevail and to be the best at what I do. Throughout the years of observing her everyday struggles, I created a goal to someday start a business with the vision of developing bionic apparatuses and mechanisms that would help improve the lives of the physically and mentally impaired and disabled.

				</p>
				<p>
					I want you to understand that even if there is a problem within your family, you must not give up on them and always have hope that it would get better. I learned that family is everything and that they will always be with you through thick and thin. I also wish that you find and cherish the things that motivate and drive you to be successful. My sister is my motivation and inspiration to improve the lives of the impaired, to make my parents proud, and to honor my sister’s sacrifices. What is your inspiration?
