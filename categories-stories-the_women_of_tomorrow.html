					As a little girl, I found myself subject to inequality, a notion of inequality that had been forced upon women for many years, especially in today’s society. As a child I wasn’t aware of this pressure, this stigma forced upon women. Blurred by my youth, I only realized these gender-biased encounters later on. I enjoyed all the same things other girls enjoyed, wearing tutus and dresses, playing with dolls, and even riding my Barbie themed bike. I enjoyed all the girly things in life while also striving to have the best grade on a math test or even winning the yearbook cover contest. I was a determined child who was always encouraged by her father to be the best, never in the context of comparing if I was the best girl or if I was better than a boy. Throughout my life, I was assured of who I was. I stood tall, proud, and had the loving support of my father with me the whole time, even after he and my mother had a brutal divorce only a couple years ago. I always had the support of my father. The occurrence of this divorce did not slow me down. Even years prior to this divorce, I was a spunky kid who according to my family, never stopped talking and never stopped trying. This included trying to complete a puzzle, complete a sentence, or complete my homework as correctly as possible <i>as a fourth-grader</i>! I was a kid full of steam, and I needed to be doing something, so I did. I began noticing that just like I loved playing with my Barbie dolls, I loved math. I also found projects that excited me, homework that filled me, and tests, although challenging at times, that gave me a sense of purpose. Something to look forward to. I loved school.
				</p>
				<p>
					Time went by, and I couldn’t escape the realities of the world, which was a society fighting to fit a certain image, and nor could I escape the people who pressured these realities. I always loved helping others, which prompted me to volunteer at the hospital at the end of my eighth-grade year. The first two years there, I loved and still love everyone I got to meet there, but this third year, I met someone who really opened my eyes, showing me the love that I have for math wasn’t just a phase but a passion, and that it would live with me forever. However, as I volunteered a woman working at this hospital insisted that I work in the medical field, claiming that going into the medical field was a done deal, which may be true, but my heart had decided long ago that it had other plans. She was not a nurse nor a doctor but was a part of the staff at the hospital. She intensely urged me to reconsider, but I just explained to her and maybe even myself that at that moment, all the science classes, projects, and math work I have ever done had sparked an interest greater than the interest I had for medicine. Math is a language with no bias to gender, which is why I pursue it despite the heavy involvement it has with men. As men dominate the engineering field, I find my presence that much more important as women aren’t represented enough. Women can do the very same work a man can, making stereotypes connecting a man to more stem related careers absurd. Making women more qualified for a career in medicine is also absurd. Most of all, not encouraging even discouraging a woman from striving for a career in stem is absolutely absurd.
				</p>
				<p>
					My confrontations with discouragement didn’t stop with the women. Within the same year, an extended family member asked what career I’d like to work in. When I told him I wanted to work as an engineer, he told me and then rushed to tell my father that I wanted to go into a <i>“dangerous”</i> career, or at least too dangerous of a career for a girl. I had only ever heard of stories where a family member discouraged the career choice of a girl, until it happened to me. I was aware of the danger the career held, but I wasn’t aware to which extent it held. With family being arguably the most influential people in a person’s life, I see the way that family disagreeing or discouraging a goal may affect anyone. I hope you, like me, can recognize to not let the choices of others dictate our own for, by the end of the day, we’re the ones facing the consequences, not our family. We’re the ones stuck with a job. We don’t live forever if we allow the opinions of others to affect us. Luckily, my father had a sister in the engineering field that only encouraged me to do what made me happy. My aunt had expressed to me herself how being in the engineering field was hard, especially as a girl. You had to work harder than maybe even your male counterparts doing the same exact work as yourself. I was always aware of the disadvantage which would come with going into a male-dominated career, but this pushed me harder to go into it and to prove people wrong in order to make known that women <i>can</i> work in these <i>“dangerous”</i> careers too.
				</p>
				<p>
					The man, a mechanic ironically, who had doubted me, like the women at the hospital, gave me doubt, doubt that I was unfit for a career because of my gender. This fear made me realize that no matter what I decide to accomplish in life, it always can be dangerous, and it may not be what others want me to do, but that was okay. These experiences taught me that the life I live is what I make it, and if I live a life with constant fear, I’ll never accomplish anything. I don’t have to be fearless, but I have to not let fear get in the way of me accomplishing any of my dreams. I decide to do what I want in life. Although there may be fear at times, I remember to always have confidence and motivation to do what I love and when I love it.
				</p>
				<p>
					I decided to join the science fair around the time the women at the hospital spoke to me, and I even decided to start learning how to drive in the same period I was confronted by the man.  I decided what I wanted. I decided to do the things in life which inspired, drove, and thrilled me, especially as a girl. I found confidence in myself, not just for being a woman, but in being a person who doesn’t let fear drive them. As someone who uses fear to change the world through my accomplishments and newfound motivation, I hope to change the world as the best goddamn woman I can be.
				</p>
				<p>
					Let it be known that you aren’t afraid, even if you are. Let it be known that you can cause change, especially if you are a woman. Let it be known that you do not stand alone, even if you feel you do.
				</p>
				<p>
					Spread the word.
