					The inhumane treatment of black lives is no new matter. Neither is the desire to acknowledge police brutality, but with the growing support of many individuals in the United States, this issue of injustice towards a race is acknowledged yet again. The Black Lives Matter movement is as big as, if not bigger than, the one hosted over fifty years ago, and with the rise of a pandemic, its fighting has only been honed on and amplified. This fight, fifty years ago, was an issue over civil rights, as people of color, who had not long before been slaves themselves, fought for the same issues of oppression that individuals of color still fight for today. This fight has shined a light on a bigger problem from the same issue, an issue of treatment, an inhumane treatment of a race targeted by the color of their skin. This is an injustice that deserves not only recognition but attentiveness which is why spokespersons such as Martin Luther King Jr. and even Malcolm X died fighting for an end to the inequality and injustices black people face. Sadly, this issue is still needed to be fought today because society still holds, to different degrees, the same racism. Racism is still heavily incorporated in everyday life which is why the Black Lives Matter movement fights back against the unlawful acts of hate the black community receives. This is done in hopes of bringing about a more peaceful world.
				</p>
				<p>
					 The effects of racism can be seen in an individual but also within architecture. Buildings today even reflect past racism. The U.S. had forced segregation upon people of color not long ago. Even as the Jim Crow laws were being abolished, the black community, alongside others, still faced terrible forms of threats, harassment, and utter embarrassment in a nation that called itself <i>“free”</i> and <i>“safe.”</i> Buildings like the pentagon had been built with twice as many bathrooms than necessary, not because they desired their employees to have more than enough restrooms to use, but because those bathrooms were separated between those of color and whites. This segregation wasn’t just enforced by the Jim Crow Laws, but by the people who were cruel to black people. It was deemed okay by society to shun upon a race. It was accepted to separate a group of people whose ancestors and possibly themselves had experienced lives in slavery, and those affected had to endure the discrimination simply because they didn’t look or speak like them. Then, as if they hadn’t been through enough, they were to be treated like dogs, being thrown out and shooed away. This treatment was reasoned with the most obscure excuses, but nonetheless, the excuses were used to normalize the dehumanization of people of color. These bathrooms, many of which still remain today, are a constant reminder of what the U.S. was and <i>still</i> is. They are a reminder that a real change hasn’t occurred, and that <i>we the people</i> are the ones who have to bring that change if there is to be any. These bathrooms, like other buildings, were built with intentions, some good while others bad.
				</p>
				<p>
					Schools were no better. Although made with the intent of having a safe space for kids to learn and aspire, not all got the opportunity to experience such an environment. Black communities, like other minority communities grouped together, were of the many communities to not receive such a safe, opportunity filled education. These schools are of the worst forms of education for their lack of opportunity or help towards the students attending, affecting the youth and the future of many black kids. Being that the people living in these communities make low income, they pay lower taxes than someone who’d be making more money. Schools take these taxes, as low as they may be, and they turn those payments into their school budget. With these low budgets, schools can’t and will not ever be able to supply kids with what they need. These black kids are in this system of poverty and lack of opportunity within their own education system. In these poorly budgeted and poorly cared for schools, these black children won't have a chance to do the great things in life that they may have been destined to do. If a little black boy dreamed of becoming a doctor and was given the opportunity and support a school <i>CAN</i> supply, he may have one day achieved this dream, thus granting the world one more doctor. Without the opportunity nor support, this dream wouldn’t have the ability to become reality. Now, more than ever, we see the importance of health officials, especially in the need for more. What if a little black girl hoped to become the next president? Even if she didn’t become the next president in her lifetime, she could have become something else like a senator or official in one of the branches of government. Whatever the outcome, she was able to get to where she was because of what was offered to her in her youth and what she aspired to do with what she was given. Today, students like the little girl and boy lack opportunities to escape poverty, or even achieve something greater than what was offered to them.
				</p>
				<p>
					These problems of a systematic issue aren’t just being seen in the U.S. Countries like Brazil are also facing a similar, if not harsher, system. Erick Alves, a black citizen of Brazil, emphasized to me the importance of education in the life of any child, but even more so of a black child. In Brazil, just like in the U.S., if you are not attending good schools from elementary to high school, then you’re instantly not promised the best future possible. As a child, Erick attended prestigious schools, which proved beneficial later on in his adulthood as he found himself an aspiring engineer. Having attended the best schools as a child, he was prepared in all aspects to continue his education into adulthood where he’d achieve the necessary education to become an engineer. Additionally, being that elementary to high school is not offered for free in Brazil, the chance at a good education as a child was critical in helping Erick achieve what he has. However, a chance at a good education didn’t come by easily for him.
				</p>
				<p>
					Erick found himself being one of the few black kids at these schools. He soon realized that many other black kids who didn’t attend good schools were receiving a sub-par education. Even before Erick was sent to these better schools, as a child, he remembers the pain his mother had to go through to get him in there. Racism in Brazil is less than what is seen in the U.S., making this issue of racism even more impactful and important for the black citizens in America. As Erick’s mother was trying to sign up her children into a better school, she was told by the principal to come back in the morning and that she would talk to her then about signing up, but soon after, security informed her that the principal didn’t work in the mornings. The principal had lied to her, and obviously, the only reason she had was that unlike the other moms there, she was black. Erick himself has been treated differently because of the color of his skin, which is why his mother has always been insistent on having her children dress presentable. Individuals would respect him, along with his siblings, more for the way they looked. As Erick grew older, he was more aware of the racism aimed towards him. Primarily filled with white older folks, he would get followed by security each time and everywhere in a local grocery store. He attended the college nearby which was the reason for his shopping at that particular store; however, when he went to that same grocery store with a white companion he wouldn’t get followed by any authority figure. This very situation follows the notion that black people are thugs or a danger to others. These stigmas could be true for any race, making it’s attachment to the black community racist.
				</p>
				<p>
					Racism can go farther than just threats, judgment, and the bad-mouthing of a black person. Racism can go as far as the killing of another person for something they can’t control, like the color of their skin, or the race they originate from, thus bringing a terrible regression in humanity and what it means to be a person. One of the biggest, if not <i>the</i> biggest issues discussed in the Black Lives Matter movement are the unjustified murders committed by police officials. This reoccurring issue was seen even before Rodney King’s murder in 91’ but not singled to only people like George Floyd or Breonna Taylor. These unarmed black individuals were killed with no real reason behind it, but with their deaths, came an uproar of anger of a corrupt police system which doesn’t get the necessary charges for taking a life, or even the necessary changes for preventing another killing as a result of this police brutality. 

				</p>
				<p>
					Many deaths are known to have been caused by police brutality towards black people, but there are probably even more that are unknown for they’re not recorded or shared by those looking out at the horrific acts of violence. These acts of police brutality need to not be taken lightly for the gratitude of the situation has only risen throughout the years as not much has been improved. Yes, police now have cameras they must wear, but who’s to say what happens when and if the police officers turn off their cameras. First and foremost, before true improvement can occur in the U.S. police system, justice must be served. For the sake of those murdered, for they can not get justice for what has been done to them, but also to help those families grieving the loss of a loved one. With a pandemic occurring in the midst of a revolution of change, signing a petition would be just as helpful as attending a protest, but would also help keep your family and the families of others safe. So please, sign a petition if you can’t donate, like the <a href="https://www.change.org/p/us-senate-hands-up-act/" target="_blank">Hands Up Act</a>, helping get justice for those unjustly murdered due to police brutality. If you would like to sign other petitions which will help the BLM movement, please go to Change.org where there are many petitions waiting for your support. If you do have the time and money, please donate to <a href="https://colorofchange.org/about/" target="_blank">Color of Change</a> or any of the other organizations centered around the Black Lives Matter website, which are all striving to help bring justice and a more humane world for black people in America. Just know you can help, it’s just a matter of doing it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Don’t be the person to enforce nor condone racist remarks. Neither do I ask you to interfere physically with people being racist, if you must, use your words, for they hold more power than even a punch does. Although difficult, be kind even when faced with hate, for it shows the strength of self-control which can be a bigger strength than even responding to hate with hate. Like Selena Gomez, an American singer, once sang,  <i>“Kill [,metaphorically, others] with kindness”</i> and only then will there be real change in racism and the hate the world holds onto. Godspeed.

					Stay informed and stay safe.
