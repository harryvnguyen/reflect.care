				<p>
					I used to thank my brain for storing my most unsettling memories in the depths of my mind. Although everything had long been said and done, my mind couldn’t seem to take the hint. I thanked my mind for keeping these devastating memories for all these years. The fact that my mind constantly wandered off and detached itself from reality and back into these dreadful memories made it excruciatingly difficult for me to be in control of myself and the person I wanted to be. It became a routine—being brought back to my past. This also made it difficult for me to have a sense of happiness because I always ended up degrading myself every time I looked back at my past. There had been something about me that caused me to feel utter guilt for things I hadn’t necessarily done. I wished and prayed that I could forget my past, but something had always held me back, and I couldn’t help but drawback memories one by one just to torment myself. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I recall one of the nights where I was sitting alone, in one of the empty dark corners of my room, trying to dismiss these dreadful memories by pointing out my flaws. I decided to sarcastically thank myself for features I thought were faulty as a way to try and better myself. I believed that identifying the problem was my first step in becoming the person people wanted me to be. While I sat in the still darkness, a memory started to slowly reform inside my mind, and I remember repeating to myself, <i>“It’s my fault, It’s my fault…I will be better,”</i> as I began seeing the disappointed and unforgiving expression scribbled onto the face of my ex-boyfriend. To this day, I can’t call anything to mind, what it was I had done to cause him such disapproval. I had caused him some sort of distress for getting in his way while he was <i>“hanging out”</i> with some friends. I attempted to keep my distance in hopes of repairing our relationship, but even that wasn’t enough for his satisfaction. As my mind had solidified around the details of this memory, I remember feeling an exact mixture of sadness and disappointment in myself as I did when I was standing there ignorantly beside him.
				</p>
				<p>
					I remembered all the times I had blamed myself for being such a nuisance to him and everyone else. I even blamed myself for being stupid enough to never understand what it was I had done or said that caused my unwelcomed presence. Due to these emotions, I kept quiet and to myself, believing that if I didn’t do anything to upset him, then maybe I would be shown the affection I’d been longing for. Maybe if he liked me...then maybe everyone else would too.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another, much earlier memory had begun to reassemble itself while I attempted to wipe away the tears from the last. However, the tears didn’t stop. The more tears I tried to clear from my eyes, the more there were. I then thanked my dark and seemingly lifeless eyes for the tears they had let slip out from them, down the sides of my cheeks, and into the dark abyss around me. I still remember the feeling of absolute weakness every time I couldn’t hold myself back from tearing up, and I would shame myself for it because I felt that I was lacking strength. I thought that I would never be able to escape my lingering emotions if I could not even keep myself from crying. These thoughts piled up in my mind as this new memory became more apparent and vivid by now, and my tears had already formed streams from my cheek to the shadowy floor.
				</p>
				<p>
					I saw my mother sitting at the table with her eyes buried in her hands, blocking her view from the reality of a broken marriage and dysfunctional family. I remember watching her tears make their way out from the tight crevice between where her hands and face met and slowly trickle down her forearms, dripping onto the empty floor around us. I wasn’t sure how I could comfort her at the time, but I still attempted to ease her pain.
				</p>
				<p>
					<i>"Mom, what’s wrong?”</i>, I asked while I sat hesitantly beside her and her pool of tears.
				</p>
				<p>
					<i>“You,”</i> my mother answered heartlessly with a monotone voice.
				</p>
				<p>
					<i>“What?”</i>, I asked, thrown off by her response. I was only about ten at the time, but I was fully aware of what had caused my mother's sadness. This would be the work of an emotionally unstable husband and father. So needless to say, I was a bit surprised and confused by her response. <i>“What did I do-”</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					<i>“Can’t you see?”</i>, she said abruptly. <i>“You’re the reason this family is falling apart! You’re the reason why your father and I don’t get along! Because you decided to tell your father made up stories about me, he confronted me and yelled at me. Because of you, I’m crying. You’re the reason…now leave me alone.”</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					As I walked to my dark and lonely room, my memory had begun to slowly fade and break away into darkness. I could feel the constant sadness and hatred as I did then after reliving that memory, not for my mother nor for my father, but for myself. I couldn’t seem to make anyone happy. There had to be a problem with me, I thought. Once again, I felt ignorant because I couldn’t understand why I caused so much distress and disappointment. Crying didn’t make me feel better, and I couldn’t have asked anyone for help because as far as I had known, my feelings and I weren’t wanted anywhere except closed away inside me.
				</p>
				<p>
					I soon began appreciating the fact that I have a smile. At the time, I believed it was a fair-faced wall that separated me from society and hid the sheer reality that broke me. I thanked my smile for being convincing enough to those around me because it appeared as if I had not a care in the world. It reassured them that they didn’t need to ask about my state of mind…even though I wanted them to understand the pain that lay behind my coaxed smile.
				</p>
				<p>
					Again, my mind had rebuilt a memory surrounding the idea of what I felt was another seemingly defective feature of mine. The darkness that surrounded me began to transform into a brighter shade of color which had seemed to promise hope. My memory had appeared to take place at school again. I was often happy at school since I could learn new material rather than be in my house reliving the same tragic stories over and over.
				</p>
				<p>
					As I walked out from the English building to Geometry class, another student had forcefully rammed their shoulder into my side, causing me to temporarily lose my balance. I was shocked and frankly taken off-guard. I turned around to see who it was. This person that I had never seen before stared straight at me as she continued walking away and laughing. At the time, I didn’t react or think to do anything about it because the situation seemed quite minor, and I was stunned. I continued to walk away from where the incident occurred and to my class and into the rest of a still promising day. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I remember wanting to believe that I was strong for the things I’d gone through but then I’d feel this nagging presence of past emotions weighing me down, preventing me from feeling the slightest possibility of strength. All I could do now was contain myself from bursting into a mess of emotions at school. Without reluctance, my facade appeared and carried me far from the truth.
				</p>
				<p>
					I wore my perfected deceptive smile and went the rest of the period pretending nothing had happened. My mind shifted to a later time in my school day and now it was lunch. I was on my way to another class to dedicate my time to studying when I was taken off-guard by the same painful shove as before. I looked back to find it was the same girl. I was hesitant but I couldn’t hold myself back.
				</p>
				<p>
					<i>“What was that for?”</i>, I asked demandingly.
				</p>
				<p>
					<i>“Nothing. I just don’t like you,”</i> she said while laughing. <i>“What are you going to do about it?”</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					<i>“What am I supposed to do, hit you?”</i>, I asked.
				</p>
				<p>
					<i>“Wow, your boyfriend was right. You really are good for nothing.”</i> I was confused. Then I realized that she had been one of his friends who he was always hanging out with, and this coincided with the time he had barked at me to leave him alone. I felt so stupid, I wanted to cry.
				</p>
				<p>
					<i>“Psh, you were a waste of his and my time,”</i> she reminded me as she sneered and again walked away into the hollowed-out hallways of my memory. While she left the room laughing, I walked the opposite way, hiding my pain behind my smile and continuing with the rest of my day.
				</p>
				<p>
					<i>“What did I ever do to deserve all this?”</i>, I quietly asked myself as I came back to reality and was again sitting against the cold wall in a dark corner of my room. When the memory finished fading away back into darkness, I placed my hands over my face. I wanted to scream. All I could think about was <i>“what did I do”</i> and <i>“why can’t I understand.”</i> I remember the feeling of my tears soaking into my palms and slowly making their way out between the tight opening from where my face and hands met. The tears didn’t want to stop, my mind didn’t want to stop, and I couldn’t stop; now my heart had begun to feel some sort of sharp pain from the intense sadness that engulfed me. It hurt, but it wasn’t the first time I had felt this pain.
				</p>
				<p>
					My heart probably took most of the beatings throughout this period of time. I had thanked my heart for allowing me to feel most unbearable feelings. It often felt as if someone were squeezing my heart, trying to drain it of every drop of blood it carried. Other times, it felt as if the strings of my heart were plucked one by one and wrapped round and round around my lungs, making it difficult for me to breathe; making me lose myself slowly...in the pain and sadness.
				</p>
				<p>
					I sat in this corner for so long, for so many years, wondering <i>“What did I do”</i>…I’ve repeated the same scenario over and over, but my mind never seemed to get tired of reminding itself of such memories. It had seemed like day after day I would repeat the same day more than once, and, sometimes, I would even lose a sense of reality and time. Even when I had felt so close to happiness that I could just grasp it in the palms of my hands, it only took a blink for that happiness to vanish before me. Instead, I would cry and cry, sometimes even for hours on end but that had never seemed to change my circumstances. My tears were a weakness that made me ashamed of myself, but that only made me cry more. My crying never seemed to end. My crying was a real frustration, but I couldn't stop.
				</p>
				<p>
					It was difficult for me to be in public, walking around among my own species yet being unable to understand anything about myself. I puzzled what made me so different and desolate from everyone around me. I had to put up this front just so I could feel normal. This smile, I used to cover up who I was, only seemed to disappear when I was alone, inside my dark and lonely room. A smile could cover so many things, but it could never cover my feelings or shut away my thoughts. They were always still there. This wall that separates me from the truth only separated me from being able to tell anyone the truth, I was still on the other side facing this painful truth straight on. The truth is what tore me apart. I could never understand the truth, and I constantly blamed myself for not getting it.
				</p>
				<p>
					<i>“Why? Why is it that I feel so bad? These things that people tell me, these things that people do to me? What did I do to make them hate me so much? As questions kept flying through me, I heard another voice. They were the ones who saw things differently. They were the ones who were enthralled in their own lives, right? They were living their own lives...and they were telling me that I wasn’t…”</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					It was at this moment that a new realization began to hit me. I was never actually the problem. I finally started to understand that for all these years, I had been blaming myself for the pain others caused me...I had been thinking I only had myself to thank for the mental anguish bestowed upon me by real manipulative monsters who crawled in and out of my life. It was at this moment that I found clarity and I realized that I didn’t want to feel this way anymore. I wanted to attempt to take control of this situation and take control of my life!
				</p>
				<p>
					The memory with my ex-boyfriend made me realize that I don’t need someone to make me feel like I belong or that I have worth. I don’t need to please someone so that they could return the favor. If someone wants to make me happy then they will do it willingly, and we can be treated equally. I don’t need to hold my tongue or shut myself out. I can be who I am and express myself how I want to. If someone has their own opinions, then those are their opinions, and if they try to use them against me, then I know that its a problem that they need to deal with, not myself. I can be open, but I also need to find the right people to confide in with my personal stories. And such people will not be ones who want me to feel bad for sharing who I am. They’ll want to help me, and I can learn to confide in people who truly do care for me. I now can learn to look for signs others give when they really do care. I’ve often mistaken words for deeds.
				</p>
				<p>
					The memory of my mother that haunted me for years and affected my relationship with my parents I now realize that there are no perfect parents. My mother’s actions still are unjustified. I now see that I am not the reason for their broken marriage. This is a problem that was their fault because they signed up for something that they weren’t committed and loyal too. Their trying to put me in the center of their problems just goes to show that they are in denial and they haven’t taken responsibility for their own actions. They let it come to this point and they used me as a way to avoid taking steps to improve their marriage My parents were in a depressive state and had built up frustration with each other that they needed to let out and work through. It was unfortunate that I was their scapegoat but now I feel less responsible for my parents. It really isn’t and wasn’t my fault. I can now make it my duty to try and encourage them to accept their own faults. I know my parents are fighting their own demons and it’s going to take time for them to heal, but with me no longer blaming myself and with the help of others they can learn to live happily again and separately and go on with their lives. They don’t have to continue reliving the past. It’s worth the wait. I have the reassurance that if they ever lash out about their problems being my fault, they are not correct.
				</p>
				<p>
					The memory of the inconvenient incident that caused me to feel unbalanced in life, betrayed and totally hurt taught me a valuable lesson. I need to take the time to build my trust with people and I can’t be quick to assume that everyone is going to like me, have my back or be genuine. No one can determine who or what I am because I am whoever I want to be. I have a destiny and I won’t let anyone get in my way. People can hurt me, they can push me around, they can laugh at me, but what they can’t do is take away my dignity. I can take control of my own life, and embrace my own worth and dignity even when others don’t or won’t. I will not give others the power to determine how my life will end up. I can handle my own feelings knowing that I know who I am and what I want in life; happiness and success. Now I can focus on my own life and grow and continue to heal from the damage. And I will learn how to deal with anyone who tries to steer me off my pathway toward a successful and happy life.
				</p>
				<p>
					This was my life-changing moment.
				</p>
				<p>
					I want to use my story and life-changing realizations to help others in similar situations. I want people who feel trapped to realize that they have the strength within themselves to find a source of motivation to take their first steps toward recovery. Then slowly, and gradually they can gain strength in themselves by inviting only positivity and encouragement into their life. Everyone has their own life to live, and no one else can live it for you. You have control of how you live your life, and no one has the right to take this from you. There are new beginnings. Don’t let blame define who you are from others. You are stronger than you think!
