			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<p>Harry and I (Alexis) have both gone through two very different destructive paths in our early lives; we were faced with difficult challenges and heartbreaking experiences that left both of us in a state of chronic depression that affected our daily lives and performances. Through the help and the sharing of experiences with one another, we learned to heal through each other's harsh realities. In the end, we were able to use our pasts as motivation to help each other out of the dark place that we were once before. Because of this, we want to create a platform where we could help others overcome similar experiences. We want to have a place where people can share their struggles and situations and the ways they overcame them. Overall, we want to help others feel comfortable with sharing their stories and motivate them to find new ways to bring positivity into their lives.</p>
