					Generally, during a pandemic, a common fear everyone develops is this idea of death. It may be because an individual is more at risk of dying, especially now from the evolved COVID-19 virus. It could also be because a person is conscious of those who are more at risk of contracting this fatal illness. No matter the reason, the Coronavirus continues to take a toll on the lives of everyone around the world. Currently, death is on everyone's mind. With events being canceled, family members passing, and school and work transitioning online, Coronavirus creates this strange new standard that is our new norm.
				</p>
				<p>
					Even with this strange new way of doing things, life goes on. People are still experiencing some of the most important and hardest moments in their lives, death being one of those experiences. Death, even aside from this pandemic, is still occurring. The deaths of those unaffected by COVID-19 should be valued just as much as those who have been affected by COVID-19. Death, no matter the cause, is an experience that should be thoroughly processed and grieved. The feeling of losing something is one shared among many right now, whether it be from a job, opportunity, or family member. It is an important feeling to understand how to process. It’s a feeling that shouldn’t be shunned upon, but instead, be given a space and time to experience. To improve on ourselves, we must set aside a time to reward ourselves during accomplishments, but also allow ourselves to experience the pain of losing, whether it be from a family member or even as simple as a sporting event. Both happiness and pain are important when it comes to building ourselves as people and bettering ourselves as a society.

					On September 13, 2020, doggy heaven gained another angel; a yapping chihuahua who, although was no friend to strangers, had a heart of gold, filled with love for those she did know. Sunshine was her name and licking was her game. She was an 11-year-old light brown chihuahua who some would call a <i>“fashionista”</i> because she had constant outfit changes when she was cold. Boy did she have the stinkiest breath ever. She’d gotten to the point where she could only eat wet food because it was softest on her fragile teeth. She had all these quirks and imperfections, all of which made me and others love her so much more for. She’ll be missed by all those she touched the hearts of, from the little boy whom she almost bit the ankle of, to my older sister who received sunshine 11 years ago as a birthday gift. Although my heart aches to think of a world without her, I know that by giving myself the time to grieve and remember the wonderful memories I shared with her, I’ll be honoring her memory and healing from her loss. A saying goes, <i>“dogs are a man's best friend,”</i> and although some may be skeptics to the extent of this statement, I’ve found the meaning behind it. Dogs, like all pets, are a man's best friend because no matter what happens, they will always stay loyal to you, protect you, and most importantly, love you. The little time we receive with pets gives us more of a reason to appreciate and love them. The need to love and appreciate things in the present goes for people and pets alike. We aren’t promised tomorrow, so we have to learn to appreciate today.
				</p>
				<p>
					It’s also important to allow yourself to be emotional. It doesn’t make you weak. You are stronger for having the ability to be vulnerable, to express love for something, and to struggle at handling a loss. It is a strength like no other. It will never be easy. Losing someone you love is like losing a piece of your heart, but you will learn to live a life that values the loss, and takes from its strength to strengthen the life you have. Don’t be afraid to love someone just because the thought of being heartbroken scares you. Take it from me, loving sunshine was one of the best decisions I ever made, and if I had the choice to do it again, I would. I’d do it for the simple reason of getting to appreciate and love her all over again. A love which I still have, even after her death.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now, more than ever, we have to learn to value love and death alike. In a world facing a deadly pandemic, we understand better than ever the importance of life, and how easily it can be over. I know it may seem difficult to be appreciative during a time of death and sadness, and although the world today may seem like a cloudy and sorrowful world, know that there is still a chance to see the beautiful rainbow, which is a life hidden behind those sad clouds. We just need to live a lifetime to settle down in order to reveal this beautiful rainbow hidden away. Although this mandated quarantine may seem a nuisance, please remember everyone is working hard to take care of the sick, find a vaccine, or taking precautions to prevent the further spread of coronavirus, and be patient. Thank you, and don’t forget your mask on your way out of your home.
