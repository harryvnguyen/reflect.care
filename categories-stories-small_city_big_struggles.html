					The first few weeks of living with my grandma were a little weird. My aunt and uncle had just left as my family moved in. They just had a baby and wanted a safe space for her. My father being the way he was, did not provide that safe space for them. It was strange almost. We hardly saw our grandmother, and our father always seemed to be gone too. He was always out getting high or struggling to find a job. He could never keep one because he would start using drugs again. He had friends who offered help, and he would always mess it all up by rejecting it. People can only receive help as long as they want to. If you do not want to help yourself, you will only push others away. My father was almost always doing that to himself.
				</p>
				<p>
					During this whole experience, he has struggled the most. Every single time he got up, he fell again, but harder every single time. I felt sorry for him. He’ll never understand how he made me feel, but he was my best friend. I relied on him for help when I needed it. I wanted to do everything he did, and spend all my time with him. He never saw any of that though. All he saw was that I was angry all the time and that I was failing school. I was only angry when he wasn’t around. Anger was the start of it all. I felt many emotions stirring inside me. I was sad that my life was falling apart. I was angry that my father was a drug addict who refused to get better. I was disappointed in the world that was all around me. I felt that everything was going wrong. My feelings were all I felt I had.
				</p>
				<p>
					I guess you can say, my brothers and I were on our own. I had to play the role of my mom. It honestly felt that way. We all slept together in a cold living room. The boys were very attached to me at this point as I was with them. I could not go a day without fighting over them against my father. I wanted them to be safe, but he didn’t care. All that was ever on his mind were drugs and my mother. I remember being in a very dark place at this time. I truly felt the world was against me. I self-harmed way too often. I found myself not caring about myself. The only people who mattered to me were my brothers. I would take them to the park a lot, the only park in town, which was on the other side of town. Every week, we would walk over there. It was our time together away from the house, away from our father. It was our peace. Our time together helped us all cope...we felt less alone.
				</p>
				<p>
					I would skip school a lot. My father was so high all the time that I knew he wasn’t paying attention. I didn’t care. I just wanted to be alone. I skipped so much that I would be so lost in my own world and my schoolwork would turn into art. I had a drawing teacher my first period, and I would just ignore everything he said. I would journal or draw because it kept me from losing my cool at school. My art teacher spoke to me one day about my work, and everything from that summer just blurted from my mouth. A single tear came from his eyes, and after that day I felt like I was understood. He told me a story about his own experiences with a broken family and gave me a listening ear. I never turned in any of the assignments I was supposed to. I turned in my feelings instead. I knew that by staying in my head I would get nowhere. I turned my head into an easel. I wrote poems and drew the world through my eyes, painting the colors of my rainbow. I made my head an art assignment without meaning to. I felt myself growing. My art teacher understood me in a way that no other teacher ever did. I took advantage of it. I would turn in my poems, my painting, and my drawings. My love towards art never caused me to fail. I ended up passing that class, and a few more. I was given the opportunity of meeting and learning from older people, people who knew my situation with listening ears and helpful resources. I saw myself as very lucky, especially under the circumstances I was in.

					During this time, the holidays were near. It was the first Thanksgiving where we were not all together. My grandma worked, so she left me alone with a turkey and food that I didn’t know how to cook. My father came home, and he and I attempted to cook it. Of course, our oven wasn’t working. We had hot sides and a cold turkey. My grandma came home and practically laughed in our faces, but it was a good memory that I will never forget. We all went out to eat at a restaurant after, and I felt okay. Not happy, not sad, but I felt okay. By this time, I was starting to realize that this was my family, and I needed to treasure all the moments we share because one day these memories are going to be all that I have.
				</p>
				<p>
					The following weeks after Thanksgiving were weird. The city grew colder, and so did I. It was like my body was adjusting again to a change, a big change. I stopped going outside because I felt trapped again. School was different. I had worked so hard just to be told I had to change schools or else graduation would be impossible. I felt defeated at this time, but I went ahead and made the change with hope for myself. By the time Christmas vacation came around, my life was never the same again. A police officer came to my home asking for my mother. Of course, she wasn’t there, but my father went ahead and gave the officer her information. That Christmas was the last we saw her for 6 months. She was arrested on Christmas Eve for many things. My dad woke me and my brothers up to tell us the news, and we all cried together. I remember being so angry and sad and felt many other feelings as well, but I refused to show anybody. I was afraid of being alone, but then again, I realized I’ve always been alone and remembered it’s okay to be alone. People who are toxic do not belong in your life. People who are constantly hurting you and abuse you don’t realize they are the reason you cannot find peace. My mother was that person in my life. When she went away, so many good changes occurred in my life. I understood then that no company is better than bad company.
				</p>
				<p>
					A few days later I met my best friend. He really changed my view on life. He showed me a world where I could be free. Meeting him was the biggest change I’ve experienced. It was an amazing one. Change kept coming, one after another. It started with a new school year at a new school, then came the apartment, and then a new person. School was honestly so great. I met the greatest human beings who hold the absolute biggest pieces of my heart. People who showed me love when I felt like love didn’t exist. Life was not perfect, but it was mine. I held it by the hand and went along with it. I felt more positive. I felt like life was going well. Changes are good and bad, but they are what we need to understand the world. I learned in so many different ways that blessings are everywhere.
				</p>
				<p>
					The next few months were not what I expected. They had me tossing and turning, but they shaped me. My little town really made me feel like I was home. I hope that we can all realize that no matter how small we feel, or how much we’re struggling, remember that we’re going to be okay. I moved away from all that I had ever known. I grew with this town facing all these itty bitty roadblocks. When I moved here, I didn’t know what I would find. Not only have I found my best friend, but I have found somewhere that gives me peace, and that I can be myself. Maybe not completely, but I know that I will get there. I know one day we all will.
				</p>
				<p>
					I wanted to share a few things about all this. This life was not expected. Growing up, I saw different goals for myself. This change really put me in uncomfortable positions. I want to say to people who read this: just because you look at your life one way, does not mean it will be that way forever. I imagined something different, and that is what I received. I received a life where I am not always appreciated, but I wake up and appreciate myself. I look into the mirror and love who I am becoming. Why? I did not give up when stones were trying to knock me down. I let myself get hurt, I felt all the pain, and I grew from it.
