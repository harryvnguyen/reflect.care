					Hang begins her story with the earliest memory from her childhood. She recalls being about five when her mother contracted a stomach disease that imminently took her life. She could only remember her mother as being <i>“funny, outgoing and overall active”</i> while she was battling her disease. <i>“I knew she loved me. She had a dog whom she [adored]. Whatever she gave to her dog, she gave to me. So I knew…”</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					Hang was now left with her sister, brother, and father. Her life, however, did not become feasible after losing her mother. As soon as she was old enough, she began working alongside her family in order to sustain a living. She explains how in Vietnam, it was very difficult to thrive since it was nearly impossible to make enough money to gain financial stability. Because of this, most of her childhood consisted of tedious and vigorous work that rarely lent any sense of enjoyment.
				</p>
				<p>
					Hang continues her story by describing the events that took place somewhere around the mid-1980’s. A new government had been formed that allowed her to do more than she previously. She elaborates that little to no one was able to attend college because they were restricted by <i>“the old government who didn’t approve of it.”</i> But soon after, as the new government replaced such laws, she took advantage of her improving opportunities. These new changes made her hopeful and sprouted her yearn for education. She was not only excited; she was overwhelmingly inspired. Hang wanted to get out of the endless hole that she and her family had been stuck in for years. She remembers how her brother purchased books to encourage her studies and support her dreams of an education.<i>“He bought me a literature book, geography book, and even a math book.”</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					When Hang was about fourteen, her family decided to move since they were continuously struggling to survive financially. <i>“We worked so hard but still had so little.”</i> The living conditions were always difficult, she explains, so they moved to seek better opportunities and fortune. They moved to southern Vietnam, which was around 700 miles away from central Vietnam where she had lived. She observed how those who lived in southern Vietnam spoke differently, and how those who didn’t speak in their dialect were often teased or bullied. Hang wanted to avoid this as much as she could, so she learned to adapt to the new and obscure dialect. It was a challenge, but her motivation aided her to circumspect this and other obstacles to come.
				</p>
				<p>
					During her adaptations to the new dialect, she began attending a new school to continue her studies. She attended school in the mornings, but once she got home, she typically worked for the rest of the day with her family. She then studied through the night, only getting four to five hours of sleep. She repeated this same routine for the next few years until her exams came.
				</p>
				<p>
					It was imperative to her that she continue her studies, even if it required tedious labor every day and adapting to a new culture. She knew that the exams were important, so she was more than willing to do what it took to succeed. She understood that education was important because it was the only way she’d be free from her struggles.
				</p>
				<p>
					Hang recalls the nights where she had to sit with an oil lamp at her side and prepare for her exams. At the time, there was no electricity in Vietnam, so she used oil lamps and worked endlessly through the night. The illuminating lights from the oil lamps often attracted all sorts of flies that were a nuisance. <i>“I wore a blanket to try and stop mosquitoes from biting me, but sometimes they got me.”</i> Nevertheless, she continued to work hard day and night so she could be prepared for her exams that would determine whether she would be eligible to attend college. She stayed motivated by telling herself that it’ll get better as long as she continued to work extremely hard and <i>“work with what [she] had.”</i> Through self-motivation and the support of her family, she was able to successfully stay dedicated to school.
				</p>
				<p>
					With each passing day, she was nearing closer and closer to the exam day. Hang knew she was prepared but still used every bit of available time to cram as much information into her brain as possible. She knew that her studies would reflect what her future would be. She knew that she needed to do her best or else all of her toils and all her efforts would be for nothing. These conjured up feelings motivated her to work all the more diligently. 
				</p>
				<p>
					At last, the exam day had come, the day she must demonstrate her abilities and prove that she was capable of attending college and being successful. She took the test and came back with her results. She was one of the few who received near perfect scores on these exams. She was one step closer; her dreams were finally coming true. She was now eligible to attend college and receive the education she’d longed for.
				</p>
				<p>
					Hang attended college for about four years, studying Vietnamese literature. During this time, she met many people and befriended many of them as well. She was constantly surrounded by people, yet felt as if no one truly understood her. However, that all changed once she met Tuan, her loving husband of over 20 years. She met him one year while attending college in Vietnam. Their connection was strong and they got along seemingly well. Soon after they began dating, they moved in together.
				</p>
				<p>
					As Hang finished up her remaining year of college, she obtained a degree that allowed her to pursue a teaching career. With her teaching degree, she decided that she wanted to stay in southern Vietnam and teach young high school students. She taught Vietnamese literature at a modest high school. She believed this was what she’d be doing for the remainder of her lifetime. Her life seemed stable; she thought she was satisfied. Little did she know at the time that her life was about to completely turn upside down.
				</p>
				<p>
					She came home one night after a long day of teaching and greeted her awaiting husband. She noticed that he was enveloped within deep thought. Tuan asked if she’d be willing to accompany him in his venture to America, as he was planning on moving there because of the promising economic opportunities it offered. Hang was dumbfounded. She knew of the opportunities America offered, but the thought of leaving her family and starting a new life perturbed her. She took a considerable amount of time filtering out the pros and cons to commence her decision making. Hang was well aware she’d have endless opportunities and much more freedom but felt as if her life's work would be lost. Similar thoughts occupied her mind and affected her overall decision, but eventually, she formulated a conclusion that she felt was best for everyone.
				</p>
				<p>
					She packed her bags and looked for any items that were most memorable to her. Her worries and fright radiated as she packed her belongings. She knew it would be a difficult process, but she looked to the future with hope. This was a huge change, but she understood that she needed to do this in order to provide for herself, her husband, and their future children. A moment of maturity revealed itself at this moment. At the time she didn’t know, but her decision would be the best one she’d ever made.<i>“Don’t be sad. Be happy with what you have. And if you really want something, do it now while you still can because tomorrow is unpredictable.”</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					Once she got to America, she and her husband only had five hundred dollars to support themselves. They had to work multiple jobs to make enough money to get a financial foothold. Throughout this time, Hang felt that coming to America wasn't entirely what she had expected and had a tad-bit of regret. However, she used her feelings to direct her towards something that would potentially be less stressful and time-consuming. She searched for jobs that would benefit her and her family. She decided that she wanted to become a nurse. Hang shifted from learning Vietnamese literature to studying Biology. 
				</p>
				<p>
					As soon as she had her goals set, she began working towards her new career. In order for her to become a Registered Nurse, she had to go back to college. Although it was much more feasible for her to attend college, she still had to continue her intense studies. She worked towards getting her associate’s degree, and once she had, she began attending a medical school where she was able to become an official Licensed Practical Nurse.
				</p>
				<p>
					Today she works as a Registered Nurse, specifically in homecare where she stays with patients and cares for them in their homes. She lives a happy, stable life with her husband and two kids whom she loves more than anything.
				</p>
				<p>
					Life is unpredictable. Life doesn't always go our way, and sometimes we must make sacrifices and take risks in order to prosper. Things may happen that we won’t expect, but we must be able to adapt and change in order to succeed and encounter more opportunities. <i>“But sometimes it is okay to fail. It could be a good thing as long as you are able to stand up from it and learn from it.”</i> Hang wants us to never give up and wants us to focus on what makes us happy. It was education that motivated her, and she hopes we find something that motivates us so that we can be as happy as she is. At this point in her life she has realized that she feels complete and is dedicated to giving back to the world.
				</p>
				<p>
					<i>“For those who aren’t able to receive support from friends, try looking for support in other places. I urge you to stay in school and seek help there. Look to adults to help and if not then seek help from your friends. I also suggest joining different activities or groups like sports or clubs. Try and find happiness in the little things you have...because you must make yourself happy before you can make others happy. Overall, education is the key and anything is possible as long as you work for it…”</i>
