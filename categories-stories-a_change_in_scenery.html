					I remember my family getting a notice a few months before my mom left. Our house was owned by a church, and the new priest there needed a new one. I don’t know the reason, but he wanted ours specifically. My parents tried fighting for it, but they eventually decided to give up. After my mom left, we lost everything.
				</p>
				<p>
					My father was always getting high, and at one point, he had taken two weeks off work to <i>“get it together.”</i> He never did. Ultimately, we lost almost everything. My father had a really good job at the time, and so did my mother. Honestly, that home was the nicest one we’ve ever lived in. It was a tan, two-story house with green grass and many flowers surrounding it. With three bedrooms, three nice bathrooms, and three living rooms, I felt rich. I felt like life would stay like that forever. I wanted this to be our home. It never was though. Home is supposed to have love, humbleness, and kindness…this place had none of those things.  It was almost like it was a never-ending warzone.
				</p>
				<p>
					At the time, I was just starting my senior year of high school. Things seemed pretty confusing. I was suffering from depression, an eating disorder, and self-harm. I felt very alone. I was supposed to be doing summer school since I had failed over a semesters’ worth of classes. My parents weren’t helping me too much either, and I had missed the first two days. I was only allowed to miss three at most.
				</p>
				<p>
					I woke up one morning, and both my parents were nowhere to be found. I called, I waited, and nothing. I ended up calling my aunt who lives across the country, and she called my grandma. My brothers and I packed a few bags, and then we moved in with her the next day. My mother was against it all, but I had nowhere else to turn. My parents left me and my siblings with hardly any food, and our home were only weeks from being taken from us. I did what I felt was necessary, I found help and just continued on from there.
				</p>
				<p>
					Well, my first day into summer school wasn’t any better...I had gotten sick. I am a diabetic and was wearing an insulin pump at the time. It was not inserted in me correctly, and I went almost 24 hours without insulin. I threw up every single item that was inside my system. It had gotten so bad that an ambulance had to come to get me from my school and take me to the hospital. I ended up staying there until 10 o’clock at night. Once my mother came to get me, that’s when things really turned bad. Instead of taking me home, she took me to her job...where her boyfriend was getting arrested. Pretty convenient, right? I watched as she chose this man, this stranger, over me. I was scared, but I couldn’t speak. I had no idea what to say. She took me back to the big house shortly after. When I returned to my room, I had wished to see my brothers the next morning and fell asleep. My wish didn’t come true, however.
				</p>
				<p>
					I woke up the next morning feeling more sick, but I couldn’t tell if I was feeling sick in my heart emotionally or sick physically. I went to shower and then to look for my father. I found him cleaning angrily. He was only ever cleaned when he was angry. He had apologized for not being there for me the day before and then he made me some food. While I was eating, he had been mumbling very angrily and loud to himself. He was saying that he should do my mom as she did him. Basically, he was saying he should’ve cheated, and at that moment, I had experienced my first ever panic attack. He carried me to the car and drove me to the hospital, and truthfully no one knew what could get me to stop. I was then put in a hospital bed and was forced to listen to my parents argue. My heart rate was literally to the point where it felt like it was about to explode, and eventually, the doctor had kicked my parents out. My heartbeat went down so fast after that that everyone helping me had sensed that it was they who caused this. Afterward, I was transported to a hospital about 2 hours away where I had spent about a week there.
				</p>
				<p>
					My father and my current boyfriend at the time visited me every day for about an hour or two at most. Other than that, I spent most days alone, listening to the nurses tell me stories about their lives as nurses. Although she had gone to the same town to pick up her boyfriend from jail, my mother never came to visit me. Real nice, right? Regardless if I was alone most of my time there, I really enjoyed it. People take being alone or <i>“loneliness”</i> as a bad thing, but truthfully, it is extremely peaceful and honestly makes the biggest differences in a person. Being alone helps people think thoroughly. You can find parts of yourself that you never really knew about, and that is so beautiful. Being alone was difficult at first, but at the end of the day, I appreciate who I grew into while being alone most of those days.
				</p>
				<p>
					After I had come back, my life was truly different. My father and I got the boys and drove to our big house. It looked so broken in a way. The grass was no longer lively and green; the flowers were wilted; leaves were scattered everywhere...it was almost like a ghost house. My room was exactly how I left it, dirty laundry, and an unmade bed. My father had lived off of Fatty’s pizza the whole week he was alone. A new notice for the following month was left on our door. No effort whatsoever was made. It was honestly so sad to see this big beautiful home turn into just a house. It’s okay though because truthfully a home isn’t just walls or windows or a roof. Home shouldn’t be a materialistic feeling. It should be where the heart is, no matter where or who it’s with.
				</p>
				<p>
					Right before school started, I went through a breakup. I felt very alone. I felt so overly heartbroken and nearly numb. I knew the relationship wasn’t going to last forever, but I was so scared of watching my parents break up that I didn’t want to watch it alone. He never wanted to be a part of it, which was okay. It was my family...it was my problem. I pushed all my friends away and just kind of went through this traumatic event by myself. My friends had no idea how to help, and I didn’t want any help. I just wanted my brothers and me to be okay again. In the meantime, I did a lot of art because it was a positive thing for me. I would watch movies with my brothers and take them to the park. I did all this to show them that it would eventually be okay. We were together and that was what mattered most to me. I only wanted to be with them at that point in life because they make me happy.
				</p>
				<p>
					Eventually, the old boyfriend pulled away, and I lost feelings, and we just grew apart. There was one day where I had been invited to a family event of his, and something happened between us. After that day, our relationship changed. I no longer had feelings, and he and I were just holding on to a string that would only end up tearing. Our relationship was toxic. We were toxic to each other mentally, emotionally, and physically. Maybe we were too young or maybe too broken and attached, but no relationship should ever get physical. It only happened once, but once was enough to end it all. Watching my family break up and going through one of my own really did impact who I chose to be around and have in my life. I really feel the need to share this because I was feeling my heart shatter every single day. For someone to be selfish and hurt you purposely is never the answer. It’s okay to break up, and it’s okay to move on to gain new experiences and views on life and love; however, it is never okay to have a toxic relationship like the one I was in. I realized I was toxic in this relationship only because of how it turned out, but I learned, and I grew. I truly hope anyone going through any type of heartache understands that love will always be kind, genuine, and 100% real. If the relationship has none of those things, then it isn’t love. Thankfully, I found someone who gives me all those and who has helped me and continues to help me grow, and I know I do the very same for him. Remember that closing a chapter and beginning a new one is okay.
				</p>

					School eventually had started up again, and I was stuck in a way I guess. I wanted to graduate, and I wanted to just get it all over with, but I guess you can say that my mind and heart were in two different places. Every day, I’d wake up wishing for a different life. Every day, I’d want better for myself and my family. I was tired every single day, and I gave up on so much...especially myself. My senior year was always a blur, and I went every single day to just come back home and do it all over again. My friends wanted to help, but no one knew how to fix my broken heart. I really didn’t want help if I’m being truthful. I was self-harming so much and starving myself that every time I looked in the mirror, I’d cry. I had no idea who I was staring at, and they too didn’t know me.I had gone through a breakup while watching my parents break up. I was so messed up that I really didn’t care about anything. Fighting with my mother when I would see her and holding my father while he cried over her, It made me feel so empty. It felt as if the roles we each played switched. I was an adult now, and my parents both became children.
				</p>
				<p>
					That summer of 2018 pushed me to grow up more than ever. Having all you’ve ever known fall apart changes you. It can sometimes turn people cold, it can make people want to run away. In my situation, I did the opposite. I took all the bad, all the changes and I grew from it all. I learned from it. I continue to do so. Changes happen all the time, good and bad. Accepting them and continuing to move forward in life is how we grow. I’m very grateful for all the changes I’ve encountered.  Some people may see this as a sad story, but I see it more as a growing experience that has and will continue to help shape me into who I’m meant to be. Remember that not all sad stories are supposed to remain sad. Most of them are growing experiences we are yet to see.
				</p>
				<p>
					During the school year when I self-harmed a lot and had an eating disorder, I avoided school and being in the house as much as possible. I really stopped caring about myself. Self-harm has been a part of my life ever since I was 12 years old. I don’t remember how or where it started. It just did. I did it up until the day I almost took my own life. September 18, 2018, was when I finally stopped. I had done a severe amount of marks all over myself,  and even took a shower and ended up passing out for a really long time. I do not believe anyone noticed, but when I woke up, I looked at my reflection in the mirror and saw myself in clothes soaked with the color red and just cried. I cried for hours. I still cry a lot thinking back on it. My unhappiness and scarred skin were constantly hovering over me, and I kept trying to run away from it. That was all I ever did. I lost a lot of weight as well. I never wanted to eat. Truthfully, I was looking for any and every way to just leave. I couldn’t though. Every single time I saw my boys, I knew I could never do that. The selfishness I felt in my heart when I thought about hurting myself stuck to me like glue. I would never run away from them. They are the sole purpose of why I do everything that I do. Without them, I really do not think I would have stayed and put up with everything that was going on in that house. I didn’t love myself in that time and place of my life and looking back at it, I wish I did. I put every person before me, and it almost killed me. I know people don’t always take it seriously when they’re told to love themselves, but loving yourself is what will save you. I promise when you look into the mirror at your reflection, the love you give to yourself will remind you why you wake up every day. I wrote every single day, wrote down all my feelings, my dreams, my fears and it helped me in so many ways. When I wrote, I felt like I could put anything and everything down, and no one would judge because it was me talking. I was talking to nobody at all except for myself and at the time, that was all I needed.
				</p>

					About mid-September, our time with the house was almost up. My father had gotten a loan, and I searched for anything and everything to call home. After a few weeks, the loan was all spent. He had lost his job and our time was running out. I was skipping school and just focusing on the real-world problems in my life. I was trying to find a job to help with bills and clothes and food, but with bad grades, It was difficult to get one. So, I started trying more and more, and eventually, my grades were going up, little by little. I had spoken to teachers and found resources at school by explaining my family’s situation. I found some help. The self-harming stopped. The grades went up. The happiness inside me was growing. I was starting to feel okay again.
				</p>
				<p>
					Unfortunately, October came around, and the house was taken away, and so we had to move in with my grandma. Moving in with her was the biggest blessing we had. I only had about a weeks’ worth of clothes with me when we left. I left my whole room, only packing about 2 boxes. One had a few clothes and shoes, and the other a few sentimental items that I felt I needed. I only took one blanket and that was all I really had. I was so used to having so much stuff that being with so little was weird to me. Honestly, it was a life-changing experience. I went from being spoiled and having so much to being a mom and having to sacrifice all I had for my brothers. Eventually, we moved to a different city, and it was the best decision for all of us. My grandma really had to sacrifice all she had for us, and I will forever be grateful for all she did. People always underestimate/judge others. Sometimes things aren’t always as they seem, so remember to always be kind to others.
				</p>
				<p>
					Life for my family changed. After moving in with my grandmother, we didn’t see our father too much, which I was most grateful for because all we did was fight. It broke my heart seeing him the way he was every single day. He’ll never know, but those were the times we needed him most, and he failed us, and that is totally okay. We all make mistakes in life, and we eventually learn. We don’t all learn the same, some of us learn by making them and others by watching. I learned by doing both. I learn every single day. We all do. While learning, we grow to forgive and learn to forget. However, we can’t forget the life-changing experiences that make us...us.
				</p>
				<p>
					I wrote this because I didn’t only lose myself, but I also lost my home and my family. I want to share this with people because we all go through things that destroy us, which can make us feel alone and want to give up. We can’t run away though, and we have to keep fighting because there are people who need us and want to hear our stories and make sure that we’re okay. This story illustrates my life from the past two years, and there is so much more I need to share. Please remember that we are all human, and we all need to be patient with ourselves. I have not recovered completely, but I am on the way. With therapy and a little love from myself and those around me, I have grown peaceful. Peace is something that we all need. Recovering from a broken heart is not easy, but having people who care makes it a bit easier. My next story will be about the struggles I and my family went through while we were all adjusting to the change of scenery.
