					Many believe that some stress is good for us and helps with daily performances in our lives. However, stress could also be very straining and taxing on one's health. Stress affects individuals' mental state, and it can even be dangerous to their bodies. Estefani Chavez, a high school student at Pioneer Valley High School, is wary of this issue, and she agrees that stress could be damaging. She elaborates on some of the ways she deals with stress and offers a few solutions on how to deal with it that she herself relies on. 
				</p>
				<p>
					 In school, Estefani is taking a full course load, including 4 A.P. classes, and she is also involved in several extracurricular activities that all tend to affect her sanity at times. She explains that her daily schedule is often <i>“overwhelming,”</i> but she believes that there are ways to overcome such stress. She agrees that <i>“school is really difficult”</i> and it isn’t until someone actually enters high school where <i>“they realize how harsh school can be, especially on their mental health.”</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					A few activities that Estefani is involved in at school include being on the varsity tennis team, being a member of the UNICEF club, Environmental club, and Hiking Club where she holds leadership responsibilities and is a part of Link Crew, a program where upperclassmen reach out to incoming freshmen and guide them through their first years in high school by coordinating specific events to encourage their studies. She explains that by participating in activities that she enjoys, <i>“it helps with dealing with stress that can come from school.”</i> Despite having a busy schedule to work with, Estefani admits that she is also a <i>“big procrastinator”</i> when it comes to school and explains that it is difficult to deal with this habit while trying to succeed in her academics. Recently, she has been able to handle these <i>“bad habits”</i> and learn from them by continuously making lists to help her stay organized and keep track of important events. She has been working to efficiently manage her time more and uses her excessive spare time to complete particular assignments ahead of time to alleviate future stress.
				</p>
				<p>
					Although she is one of the higher achieving students at her school, Estefani explains that not all students need to be perfect in order to be successful. She acknowledges how <i>“It’s difficult to cope with the idea of not having straight A’s”</i> and expresses that it’s <i>“important to consider mental health and become aware of one's limitations.”</i> Further, she elaborates on how she is willing to accept the reality of receiving a <i>“C”</i> in a course now, whether it be in A.P. Biology, A.P. Spanish Literature, or any other course as long as she can maintain her stress levels: <i>“I’m aware that there are many opportunities to raise your grade, but it doesn’t help when I also have to deal with additional assignments like Cornell notes which are mainly busy work that only takes up time rather than better my understanding of the material.”</i> In this case, one may consider spending less time focusing on assignments that aren’t geared toward bettering their education and instead spend more time on assignments that will help one's understanding.
				</p>
				<p>
					Unfortunately, Estefani is one of many who attends an overly populated high school. Her school contains over three thousand students which can make it quite challenging to receive individual assistance with coursework. In these overpopulated schools, many teachers are often occupied and sometimes fail to follow a particular schedule. This can make it extremely difficult for students to understand what teachers are expecting of them, and it can also cause them to struggle in the class as a result. Estefani admits that <i>“It’s not necessarily the homework”</i> that causes her to struggle, <i>“but more the concepts and how to really apply them.”</i> She also adds how at times it can be a bit stressful that she doesn’t see many teachers <i>“making an effort to help their students either.”</i> Due to the unreliability of the teachers, Estefani had to develop independent skills on her own to help her succeed in school. She points out that <i>“being patient and understanding”</i> is also very important when trying to develop new skills or in trying to make any progress in general.
				</p>
				<p>
					From the long school hours, tiring practices, community involvement, and endless piles of homework, stress became an issue that eventually consumed Estefani’s day to day life: <i>“Sometimes I become overwhelmed with my interactions with others because I felt as though I have an instinct that leads me to say yes to things I know I cannot handle. As a result, It places a lot of stress on me because I feel that I give myself more responsibilities that I have to fulfill, or else I’d let people down.”</i> In order to help with the additional stress that comes with trying to be a good friend, she tries to make time for herself by exercising. Whether it be in tennis or on her own time, Estefani realizes how beneficial exercise is in relieving stress. She also adds that the extra exercise is a way for her to finish her work quicker as she is able to really <i>“feel the time crunch”</i> and use it to her advantage.
				</p>
				<p> 
					Although Estefani already appears to have a full plate with school, she still carries responsibilities outside of school, especially at home. She enjoys spending her spare time helping her community by volunteering at her local hospital where she cares for those in critical need. At home, she lives with her mother, father, younger sister, and her two dogs. She also has an older brother, but he is currently serving in the Marines. Ever since her brother left for the Marines, she has been responsible for taking care of her younger sister and tending to household responsibilities which include cooking, cleaning, caring for her dogs, and more. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Because Estefani is the second oldest, her parents have many expectations of her, and oftentimes, they compare her to her brother. She feels constant pressure to be the best because her parents want her to follow an <i>“actual”</i> career path. She adds that her brother is also <i>“limited with giving support and encouragement.”</i> Estefani explains how the <i>“discouragement”</i> from her family had at one point added to her prior stress because she felt that her work was constantly being monitored and critiqued to where she would have to avoid her passions. She felt as if she had to be at the top because of her parents’ expectations. Regardless of these negative expectations placed upon her, Estefani has transitioned into a mindset where she knows that if she can find things that make her happy, she will pursue it. Furthermore, she deals with the criticism by using it as motivation for her to only try harder to prove her passions are worth the time and effort.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the long run, Estefani wants to pursue a track in pre-med alongside striving to achieve her goal of being successful. She is currently working to get into her dream college, Grand Canyon University, then follow a career pathway leading her towards a job as a pediatrician.
				</p>
				<p>
					<i>“Right now, I am working to get a 4.0 this year, and I am looking for a good job too. I hope that in time my hard work will pay off, and I can eventually pursue and accomplish all my goals. I want to point out that I am still a normal high school student like everyone else. I have many common interests. I really love dogs; I have two currently but in the future, I wish to have at least five. Also, I have realized that there are many areas I can improve in my life and I want people to take away from the rash realities I’ve experienced as a way to find their own motivations. Don’t let the cracks in the road slow you down; if anything they should be a source for you to find encouragement, to keep moving forward, and to self-improve. Don’t give up. It may be difficult but there are solutions. In my case, I dealt with the stress that consumed my life by doing things that made me happy or satisfied me such as creating lists to keep my life organized. Try to find what makes you happy in order to combat stress. Once you find your perfect stress reliever, life will become much easier and it will leave more room for you to be content with yourself.”</i>
