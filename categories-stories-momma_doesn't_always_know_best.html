					<h2>By Brianna Marie</h2>
					<h2>Friday, 08/07/2020</h2>
				</div>
				<p>
					My name is Brianna Marie. I’m nineteen years old and was originally born and raised in Santa Maria, California. I am currently living in Guadalupe, and I have been for about two years now. A few words I would use to describe myself are strong, determined, and flawed. I’ve always been very strong, especially when I think back to the times I wasn’t. I’m also very determined. When I want something, no matter what it is, I will do whatever it takes to get it. Most importantly, just like every other human in this world, I am flawed. I always have been and always will be.
				</p>
				<p>
					I like to think of myself as an artist. I make art. I write art, and I am art. We all are art in our own ways. I paint. I color. I write. I journal. Most of all, I create. I create my own world that makes me feel safe and that makes others feel more comfortable and secure. My feelings are scattered in almost all I do, in all I am, and in everyone, I invest my time, love, effort, and motivation into. I give myself the motivation to keep going. My family, my lover, and most of all, the life that is currently being lived is what gives me my motivation. Although they may drive me crazy, my beautiful family motivates me to wake up every single morning with a smile on my face. They are mine, and I wouldn’t exchange them for the world. Currently, it is just me, my two kids, my grandmother, and my boyfriend whom I call my motivation. My children are eleven and four years old, and they are relatively close to my age because they are actually my younger brothers. They have been in my care for so long that calling them my kids is purely natural to me. I’ve been taking care of them starting when I was fairly young. Every single day, I have woken them up, fed them, got them ready for school, and took care of them. They’ve always leaned on me and depended on me. I spent a lot of my childhood taking care of others along with myself, and I continue to do so to this very day. Due to all the responsibilities that come with caring for my siblings and doing my job, I have chosen not to pursue a college education. I am okay with this because I realized that I am not in a very good position to seek a college degree; however, I do plan on taking a few classes at a community college in about a year or so. It’s okay to not go to school, school is not for everyone. For me, not going was the better choice because you have to be focused on going to school to do well. Your mental health has to be pristine because the workload is an extreme amount to handle. Juggling school, kids, work, and myself would have been extremely difficult. We, as people, put others first way too often. It’s like an instinct, and loving others is beautiful, but we need to remember to love ourselves most of all. I am choosing to put my kids before me, and that was my choice. I am learning to love myself and heal my heart and mental health during this break. That is my main focus currently.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have no idea who or what I want to be yet. It seems like I want to do everything, but my daily schedule makes it really difficult for me to do anything for myself, and that is totally okay, for myself and for anyone in the same boat. From working early morning shifts to coming home to cook, clean, and be a role model for my kids, it is a struggle, but I love it all. Right now, I put my family first, and they need me, as I need them. Without them, I would not be who I am today. They are the reason I do what I do. I have gotten so close to them, and I suppose this is where my story begins. I will be sharing a lot about the last two years of my life, but I am going to start at the very beginning when my mother left.
				</p>
				<p>
					Growing up, my mother and I were not close whatsoever. I always felt like she hated me in a way. I was never her number one. It always felt like a competition for her love. She always kept to herself, and never once do I remember a time when affection was shown. It either felt forced or felt like there was no love to be given at all. It makes me uncomfortable when she tells me that she loves me or tries to show me that she cares because I don’t know if I can believe her or not. That’s sad, isn’t it? Mothers and daughters are supposed to be best friends, and sometimes I won’t even consider her a friend. I can’t. Sometimes I catch myself feeling jealous when I see other mother and daughter relationships because I don’t have that, and I might not ever get to have a relationship like that with her. I’m not even sure I want one with her at this point. I know that may sound crude because sometimes it does seem like she is trying, and people tell me to stop pushing her away, but I can’t help it. She has caused me so much pain. Pain I never knew existed until I felt it, and she was the cause. I do not like blaming others for the way I feel because they are my feelings. However, that time she was the cause.
				</p>
				<p>
					My mother left our family for another man and for drugs. She chose a life of crime and lies, and has no remorse for her actions. After all, she did land herself in a jail cell. She can beg and cry and say sorry, but I won’t believe her if she said that she really cared because if she did, she wouldn’t have left things the way they were. We all are human. We all make mistakes. We all pay for them. My mother is doing so currently. As humans, we mess up, and we are able to grow from it. That is just the way life flows. However, there is no excuse for anyone to treat people with disrespect and hate, induce that much pain, and try to avoid all the consequences. Blaming others, lying, and purposely trying to put a person in so much pain to break them is purely wrong. It is something I cannot and will never understand.
				</p>
				<p>
					Before she left, my mother was unhappy with my father, her job, her life, and most importantly herself. She never made an effort to change her ways, and she never wanted to grow. She continued to be a bitter person. Why? I have no idea. Bitterness is a terrible quality to have because it turns you against the world and against yourself. It causes anger, jealousy, and especially spiraling hatred. Because of this poor trait, my mother ended up quitting. She quit trying. I almost did too as a result. I tried to cope by cutting. I started at the age of twelve, and stopped a few years after. I don’t remember how it started, it just sorta happened. It was something I used as a way to try and feel again; however, I do not encourage this whatsoever. I do remember why I stopped. There was a night where I had proceeded to put over fifty cuts on my body. I had bled throughout the shower. I came out and I had fallen on my bed and passed out for a good six hours. No one noticed, except my brothers. When I woke up, I was drenched in sweat and blood. My brother thought I was sleeping, but when I saw his face, I knew I could not do this anymore. It wasn’t healthy, and I pray for whoever reads this that they never have to inflict pain upon themselves. After that night I stopped. I learned healthy ways to cope by writing down my thoughts or talking about them, even if it is to myself. I learned to love the people who loved me. I also found a therapist who I felt comfortable sharing my feelings with. There are so many ways to heal. So please, whoever you are, love yourself throughout it all. When it got too difficult for my mom to handle, she decided to run away instead of tackling the situation head-on. It is okay to be unhappy, but there is so much that can be done to fix it. Leaving your kids to a seventeen-year-old for a drusg-addicted father was unforgivable, but I'll save this for another story.
				</p>
				<p>
					My mother chose drugs and a drug addict to run away with. Hard to believe right? Well, it’s the truth. I want to point out that I don’t hate my mother, if that’s what most of you are thinking. I could never <i>hate</i> her. Hatred is an ugly feeling, and I could never hate anyone. I never want anyone to feel hate. Hatred destroys people and that is what destroyed my mother. She used it to destroy all of us in her path, but ultimately failed. So in the end, she left and I am still trying to cope with it every single day. I wake up each day and tell myself, <i>“You got this girl.”</i> I move in the direction she refused to go in. I go to work and work my butt off to save and get where I want to be. I cope by being human. I will say her leaving has made me a better person. It has taught me the important difference between love and hate. Hate is anger. It is envy. It’s being jealous that your daughter went on a plane first. It is getting mad that your brother did something you’ve always wanted to do. It is being negative. Hate is ugly. Now, love, love is beautiful. It’s waking up and doing what’s right even when you really don’t want to. Love is taking your brothers to the doctor because you worry about them. It’s about making sure your heart is okay. I could go on and on about what love is, but we all have our own definition. Just know that love has brought me closer to my family, and it has allowed me to become a better human being. This experience has taught me how to appreciate who and what I have because I’m aware that one day it could all be gone.
				</p>
				<p>
					People come and go. We change. We live. We love, and we learn. Sometimes in the process, we succeed or fail, but what matters most is that we grow from it. My mom had yet to grow before she left. To this very day, she lacks growth from her mistakes. She hurt my family when she turned her back away from us, especially when we needed her the most. She hurt me with her careless actions and poor choices. It sucks that it had to come to this, but these experiences made me stronger. For example, I was on the verge of not graduating. I failed over a whole semester worth of classes. I stopped trying then. I didn’t believe in anything at all. I met with a teacher one day who made me have a sorta wake up moment. He was so kind. His heart was literal gold. He believed in me. I found that many others believed in me as well. Just like that, I started to believe in myself again. I changed schools, found a family, graduated with a 3.8 GPA, became part of leadership, did softball, and so much more. My mother missed all that. I did not speak to her for six months. I didn’t need her. I needed me, and just like that, I felt myself growing, succeeding, moving forward. I want you guys to remember a few things. One, just because they’re family, there is no reason to put up with their toxic ways. Two, someone will always love and believe in you, even if it is only yourself. Lastly, <i>keep on swimming</i>, even when the current is holding you down. It will make you stronger.
				</p>

					The woman who broke me wasn’t my mother, I have no idea who that stranger was that was consuming her. She always got high, spread lies, and nobody noticed. I sat there for years listening to a stranger who pushed me away and just gave up on my family. The green in her eyes no longer look the way they did growing up. I haven’t seen her since September of 2019, but I speak to her every single day. Our relationship varies. She tells me sorry and that she loves me every single day. However, I mumble when I say it back because talking to her makes me question love sometimes. A mom should never make anyone question what love really is. Rather, a mom is supposed to love you. She carried you for nine months and birthed you. Although that isn’t always the case. On the other hand, the person that you should never question love from…is yourself. She may have birthed me but at the end of the day, I hold myself while I sleep. I do hope that when I see her again that the beauty of Reflect can shine a light into her soul. I hope that one day, we can form a real and meaningful relationship. I want her to find love, beauty, hope within herself. I want her to provide for herself. I want her to find all the wonderful things in life that she never taught me. Only then, will I see a change and hopefully a future for us.
				</p>
				<p>
					In time, I hope to have children of my own, so that I can teach them the beauty of life and show them how to love. I want to teach them the importance of honesty and responsibility. I suppose one can say that my mom leaving was sort of a good thing since I learned so much. It taught me many things like why it’s important to brush your teeth every day, why we need to take the kids for checkups at the doctor so much, etc. It also taught me how to be humble, why staying with someone who makes you unhappy is wrong, and understanding why life happens the way it does.
				</p>
				<p>
					At times, I do get quite sad thinking about it from time to time, but I don’t always show it because sometimes I forget that she is even gone. No matter where she is, her memory is always with me. My mom wasn’t always a bad human being. I remember she laughed at almost everything. Her favorite color was cherry red. She absolutely loved Scooby-Doo. Occasionally, she did fight for me when I needed it. She is very strong-willed and knows what she wants and does what it takes to get there, even when it wasn’t the right thing. My mother is my mother, and she always will be.
				</p>
				<p>
					I think that people need to understand that with relationships, whether they are family, friends, or a romantic interest, the pain will always be there, and the way we cope and continue our lives is what defines us. My mom used her pain to find safety, her unhappiness to fight, and her anger to love. She did have good intentions. I used to get bullied at school, and she used her threats to get them to stop, and I have done similar things. I fought for a relationship I was unhappy with because I was too afraid to be alone. I went off on a kid who I walked in on, screaming cuss words at my brother. I did yell at him to be respectful, but I may have been a tad bit meaner than I should have. Although those were not my best choices, I learned love should not be painful and bullying should not be handled with more bullying. I guess you can say, I understood my mom by playing some parts of her. Our relationship isn’t the best, but after experiencing my own series of pain, I understand more, and I hope that one day she can meet me halfway.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the next story, I want to explain what I lost and what I gained from this. We lose, we gain, but in the end, we become better. If you are ever having a bad day, just remember you are absolutely loved by someone and life is full of surprises.
