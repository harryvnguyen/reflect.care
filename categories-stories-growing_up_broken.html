					I was only eight years old when I stopped having the slightest bit of confidence in myself. I was about nine when I realized that I wasn’t the type of girl other children wanted to play with, and soon, I realized that many people tried to avoid me. As a kid growing up, I was exposed to many experiences that I shouldn’t have been experiencing at my age. I had lost that little voice inside of me that told me that I was wanted. Around the same time, I realized that I was not as smart as the other kids. The perception of me was being slow or stupid.
				</p>
				<p>
					Not only did my classmates find it amusing to remind me of this daily, but the teachers decided to chime in and make me feel worse. My parents had also begun noticing that I was slower than other children, but they did not expect much from me. I was the oldest after all, and I was going to be the one setting the examples and such. I continued living through the torment and degradation of my peers, trying to ignore the harsh words they’d say. I was also moved from the regular classes into the slower classes where I could get more individual help. However, the atmosphere didn’t change, I was still seen as the slow, stupid child, even to the teachers.
				</p>
				<p>
					Later, I learned that the learning disability I had was a common disorder known as dyslexia. Although I had never been diagnosed with it, I did my own research and noticed that I exhibited most of the symptoms of dyslexia. I was mortified. Why did it have to be me?
				</p>
				<p>
					I didn’t want this condition to take control of my life. I did not want it to define me. I wasn’t going to stand by and let people decide whether I am slower than other kids or plain out stupid. With the heart and brain of a nine-year-old, I made a promise to myself. I promised that I would not let people tell me who I am or what I was going to be. I was going to prove them wrong, no matter how long it took or no matter how hard it may be. I was going to keep my promise.
				</p>
				<p>
					It was hard, very hard actually. I forced myself to do everything I did not want to do. I was not meant to be a scholar, but I forced myself to do everything a scholar would do to develop my incapabilities. On top of struggling with the difficult workload, I also dealt with the harsh discouragement that came along with it, not only from the teachers and students I saw nearly every day but also from my parents whom I lived with.
				</p>
				<p>
					My parents were rarely helpful or motivational. They never pursued an education after high school. My mother had to drop out of high school because her family struggled to obtain a sustainable income. She worked alongside her family in the fields. My father had a similar story; he pursued the agriculture business while my mom eventually found herself waiting tables at a restaurant. This attitude about education made it painfully difficult for me to gain any encouragement or motivation. This, however, did not prompt me to break my promise. I worked hard, day and night. I read books that had long titles, which meant that it was something that “smart people” would read. I even looked for the smallest things to read such as cereal boxes, pamphlets, or labels. Even if it was one simple word, I felt it still benefited me. Sometimes I would read them over and over again; just so the words would stay in my memory.
				</p>
				<p>
					On my tenth birthday, I was gifted with my very first journal. To my surprise, it was the first time I had ever seen one. It was a beautiful leather stitched book with a light chocolate color all the way around it. I remember as soon as I opened it, I began writing and writing until I filled each page. I’d write from top to bottom, side to side, and fill in all the margins with all the words I learned from the new books or cereal boxes I read. Not only was this the time I began my collection of journals, but it was also when I began to develop my writing skills. I wasn’t afraid to write. I knew I had mistakes in my writing, but I knew that it would help if I learned how to fix those mistakes. Writing has always been my favorite because I had never felt forced to write. It was more of a hobby than anything. Writing was where I could truly express myself. Writing is where I was free to be anything I wanted. Although it was an enjoyable aspect of my life, it still took me time to fully develop adequate writing.

				</p>
				<p>
					To fulfill my promise is the longest goal that I’ve worked a considerable amount of time to achieve. It wasn’t until I was in high school when I was finally able to demonstrate my capabilities. It did take time, 7 years to be exact until I truly felt confident in my reading and writing skills. However, I’m not a professional writer nor a fast reader. I still struggle. At times I do fall, but I often enjoy surprising the people who’ve doubted and discouraged me. Ultimately, the success and satisfaction I’ve received from my motivation to work hard came from that one simple promise.
				</p>
				<p>
					It took me years, and I’m still not nearly as eloquent or orthographic as some of the other students in my classes. However, I’m accustomed to the fact that I am dyslexic, and I can’t be as talented, but my hard work and determination still allows me to be in the same classes as them. I can still learn from them, and I am still growing.
				</p>
				<p>
					I want people to know that hard work really does pay off. It will take time. It could take days, months, or even years, but hard work and determination will reveal accomplishments in the future. The key is to not give up, no matter how excruciating the journey may be. It will be worth the wait, and the work put into it will have 10 times the expected result. Moreover, find ways to encourage yourself and to stay dedicated to a goal because there will be no one who could motivate you as much as you could. It’s possible as long as you believe in yourself and stay committed to your goals.
